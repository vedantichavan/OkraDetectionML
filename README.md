 Thermal imaging offers an innovative, non
invasive approach to determine the freshness of 
agricultural 
produce. By analyzing temperature 
gradients and moisture retention, it provides insights into 
produce quality that traditional imaging methods fail to 
capture. This study investigates the freshness detection of 
okra using thermal imaging, employing the publicly 
available Okra Dataset. Three computational models 
were developed and compared: GoogLeNet for deep 
hierarchical learning, SegNet for detailed segmentation, 
and a hybrid model combining Random Forest (RF) and 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for balanced 
performance. 
All three models performed well in the 
classification task, with SegNet performing the best at 
99.01%.
